Work for Pitch Paint




Instructions for use:  With the app you can draw sound in space and watch it play as the notes light up a color. 
- Every note is mapped to a color and will always be the same color every time. In this way the user can see the relationships of the notes based on what colors they are. Notes light up their color at the exact timing when the note is played. 
- Notes (or pitches) are along the vertical axis. The lowest pitch is by the users shoes and the highest pitch is above their head. You can draw single notes or entire strings of notes in space and theyâ€™ll loop over each other (much like a music loop pedal) so you can create a melody. Since all the notes are aligned in space the user can visualize how pitches at certain distances from each other harmonize.
- The faster the user draws a string of notes the faster the notes are laid down, and the slower the user moves their arm the slower the notes are laid down. 

Controls: Pressing up on the touchpad tests a note - so you can hear a pitch in space before laying it down
        Pressing down on the touchpad undoes the last note string of notes or note that was drawn.
        Pressing left or right on the touchpad changes the instrument in that hand.
        The trigger is used to draw the notes.

The user can draw with both hands at once or one at at time if the please.
